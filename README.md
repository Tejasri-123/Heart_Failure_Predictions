# *Heart Failure Prediction App*
This is our team project on machine learning
## *Goal - Predict the heart Failure by using various machine learning models*
This project aims to predict the occurrence of heart failure based on various clinical features. The app provides a user-friendly interface for inputting patient data and obtaining predictions using machine learning models.

## *Installation*

### *clone this repository*
git clone git@github.com:Tejasri-123/Heart_Failure_Predictions.git

### *Now install requirements*
pip install -r requirements.txt

## *Usage*

*I deployed this app by using the streamlit*
### Step 1 : Run the Streamlit app
  streamlit run app.py
### step 2 : Access the app in your browser at 'http://localhost:8501'.

Here it looks like when you open in your browser

## *Models*

The app utilizes the following models for heart failure prediction:

* Random Forest Model
* Logistic Regression Model
* Decision Tree Model

Each model was trained using a labeled dataset and achieved high accuracy in predicting heart failure.

### *Dataset*
The dataset can be found at 'heart_failure (1).csv'.
